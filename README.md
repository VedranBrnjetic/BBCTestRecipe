# [BBC Test Recipe](http://vedran.uk/bbctest/)

This project has been built for the purpose of hiring process for BBC - Full Stack Developer role. I have built it on LAMP stack using PHP/MySQL platform with addition of jQuery for AJAX calls to API.

I chose to build the project without using PHP frameworks to display the ability to develop on all levels from database layer, model layer, application layer to front end and presentation layer. I used a frontend theme based on Bootstrap for rapid prototyping and responsive design.

## If the project was chosen to continue

In case I was chosen to continue with this project to further improve the existing features and implement additional features, I would rewrite it on an established PHP framework of choice for stability and security purposes and because no one wants me to "reinvent the wheel".

## Start Bootstrap frontend theme

For this project I used the modified Start Bootstrap theme to quickly develop the interface.

Start Bootstrap was created by and is maintained by **David Miller**, Managing Parter at [Iron Summit Media Strategies](http://www.ironsummitmedia.com/).

Start Bootstrap is based on the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework created by [Mark Otto](https://twitter.com/mdo) and [Jacob Thorton](https://twitter.com/fat).
